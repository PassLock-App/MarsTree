# MarsTree
 🍎🍎🍎MarsTree主要是针对unity游戏工程的混淆工具  1️⃣支持异或文件资源，几万个类名，数十万函数名，添加垃圾代码修改unity游戏的逻辑树。  2️⃣同时对unity SDK工程进行代码混淆，字符串加密、修改代码逻辑树进行了有效的支持。  3️⃣并且提供免费的隐私政策网址和技术支持网址的服务，项目已经经过大量实测和真实提审。  🍎由于苹果审核在人工审核的各种不可控因素，MarsTree不支持保证必须能上架。有任何问题您可以邮件czc1943@126.com联系作者。谢谢！  🍎🍎🍎 MarsTree is mainly a confusing tool for unity game engineering, supports XOR file resources, tens of thousands of class names, hundreds of thousands of function names, and adds junk code to modify the logic tree of unity games. At the same time, the code confusion of the unity SDK project, string encryption, and modified code logic tree are effectively supported. And the free privacy policy website and technical support website services have been provided. The project has undergone a lot of actual measurement and real review. However, due to the various uncontrollable factors in the manual review by Apple, MarsTree does not support the guarantee that it must be available. If you have any questions, please contact the author at czc1943@126.com. Thank you!
